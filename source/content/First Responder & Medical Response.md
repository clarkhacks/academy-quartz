# First Responder & Medical Response

## Combat Gauze Application

1. **Identify major bleeding site** (look for blood sweep)
2. **Apply hemostatic agent** (Combat gauze) as wound packing
3. **Pack to the bone** and fill the entire wound cavity
4. **Apply direct pressure** for at least 3 minutes
5. **Apply over-bandage** to secure

> [!warning] If hemostatic agent is not working
> - Remove first bandage
> - Repack the wound

## Chest Seals

### Types of Chest Injuries
- **Pneumothorax** – Air collects between lungs and chest wall
- **Hemothorax** – Same as pneumothorax, but with blood instead of air
- **Hemopneumothorax** – Blood + air combined
- **Tension pneumothorax** – Heart and trachea become displaced

### Signs and Symptoms
**Major Sign:**
- Shortness of breath

**Additional Signs:**
- Rapid breathing
- Anxiety
- Distended neck veins
- Shock

## Respiratory Guidelines

1. **Identify and seal open chest wounds**
2. **Use an occlusive dressing**
3. **If seal is non-vented**, remove/burp the chest seal
4. **Reapply the chest seal** as needed
5. **Always check for exit wounds**

> [!warning] Exit wounds may not be directly behind entry wounds — consider ballistics

## Circulation & Shock Indicators

- **Altered mental state**
- **Body temperature change**
- **Assess capillary refill**
  - More than 3 seconds = concern
  - Pressure on skin stays white instead of returning to pink
- **Pale, moist skin**
- **Fast breathing**
- **Keep patient talking**
- **Assess for firearm retention ability**

### Radial Pulse Check
- Presence of a radial pulse = Systolic BP ~ 80 mmHg
- Blood Pressure (BP): Written as Systolic / Diastolic

## Hypothermia Management

- **Minimize exposure**
- **Replace wet clothes**
- **Cover to retain heat**

### Why It Matters
Even a small drop in body temp can:
- Interfere with clotting
- Increase risk of bleeding to death

### Prevention Measures
- **Reapply body armor** for heat and safety
- **Use disposable metallic blanket**

> [!warning] Threat may still be active

## Recovery Position

- **Left side down**
- **Right arm under chin**, over left arm
- **Left arm bent under head**
- **Right knee bent**

> [!caution] Use caution if neck injury is suspected

## Scene Considerations

- **Security**
- **Ingress/Egress points**
- **Communication**
- **Location awareness**

## Airway Management

- **Use head/chin tilt** – the "smelling position"
- **If possible, have the patient maintain their own airway**
- **NPA (Nasopharyngeal Airway)**: If the patient is talking, they do not need an NPA

## ABC Priority

**ABC = Airway Breathing Circulation**

# Law Enforcement's Role in Medical Response

## Key Points
- **LEOs are frequently first on scene**
- **LEOs are often the target** during rescue or medical incidents

> [!note] Study Reference
> Study the 1997 Hollywood Bank Robbery

## Types of Trauma

- **Blunt Trauma** → Smashes, hits, falls
- **Penetrating Trauma** → Gunshots, stabs, etc.

## Bleeding Control (Review)

1. **Apply bandage and pressure**
2. **If bleeding continues**, use a tourniquet (after brief assessment)
3. **Hemostatic agents** speed up clotting

## Situational Awareness

- **Always know your location** → Make a habit of reading street signs and mile markers
- **Egress** = Exit
- **Ingress** = Entry

## Evacuation & Officer Safety

### If an officer is wounded:
- **Prevent further injury**
- **Evacuate ASAP**

### Disarming an injured officer:
- If they cannot stay in the fight
- If they may wake up combative
- If they pose a risk to themselves

### Survival Mindset
Even if wounded — stay in the fight, administer self-aid, and resist until evacuation

## EMS Professional Levels

| Level | Role |
|-------|------|
| **EMR** | Basic skills, keep alive until higher care arrives |
| **EMT** | Basic Life Support |
| **Paramedic** | Advanced care (EKG, airways, IVs, medications) |

- **Scope of Practice**: What a provider is trained and allowed to do
- **Standard of Care**: The expected level of performance

## EMR Capabilities

- Tourniquets
- Shock treatment
- Bleeding control
- Splints
- Assist with medications
- CPR
- AEDs

## Triage & Scene Management

1. **Assess your available resources**
2. **Call for help** if the number of patients exceeds your capacity
3. **Gain access to the patient**
4. **Check ABCs** → Airway, Bleeding, Consciousness

## Scene Intelligence Factors

- Weather
- OPSEC
- Disease risks
- Plant and wildlife threats
- Hostility in the area
- Presence of additional individuals

> [!important] LEOs must protect the public while upholding the law

## Documentation & Reporting

**Ensure accurate reports** — you may be called to testify years later

## Ethics & Legal Responsibilities

- **LEOs have a duty to act**
- **Not covered by Good Samaritan Law**, but still protected (except in gross negligence)

### 4 Elements of Negligence:
1. Did the person suffer an injury?
2. Did you have a duty to act?
3. Did you act below the standard of care?
4. Did your actions cause harm?

## Abandonment

**Do not stop care** unless you hand off to someone of equal or greater training

## Consent

| Type | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Expressed** | Patient asks for help or submits to care verbally/nonverbally |
| **Informed** | Patient is given info, understands risks, and chooses care (must be 18+) |
| **Implied** | Used when patient is unconscious or unable to consent; assume a reasonable person would agree to care |

### Minors
- If treatment delay would cause harm → begin care, even without parent
- **Exceptions**: Military, emancipated, or married minors may give consent

## Patient Refusals

If patient is alert and oriented, they can refuse care → Even if their condition is life-threatening

## Legal Concepts

- **Durable Power of Attorney**: Appoints someone to make medical decisions on the patient's behalf
- **Confidentiality**: Protected under HIPAA - Do not share medical info unless required by law

## Mandatory Reporting to Law Enforcement

Medical professionals must report:
- Knife wounds
- Gunshot wounds
- Dog bites
- Domestic violence
- Reportable infectious diseases

## Forensic Awareness in Medical Care

1. **Scene safety comes first**
2. **Provide care** — evidence is secondary
3. **Preserve the scene** whenever possible

### Forensic Best Practices:
- Document and secure anything removed from patient
- Note and document anything moved or contaminated
- Record victim location and position
- Don't cut bullet holes or slashes in clothing unnecessarily
- Only EMS can pronounce someone deceased (unless extremely obvious)

## Abuse & Sexual Assault Response

- **Be nonjudgmental**
- **Encourage victims not to**:
  - Bathe
  - Brush teeth
  - Wash up
  - Urinate until they reach a hospital
- **Offer a clean sheet** from the emergency vehicle
- **When possible**, match the care provider's gender to the victim

## Officer Wellness

**Your mental and physical health matter.**

### 5 Components of Wellness:
1. Spiritual
2. Occupational
3. Physical
4. Personal & Emotional
5. Family & Social

### Statistics:
- **Police suicide rates** are 2x that of the general public
- **Divorce rate among LEOs**: 60–75%

> [!tip] Try to have non-LEO hobbies and friends to maintain balance

## Infectious Disease Transmission

### Transmission Routes:
- Air
- Body fluids
- Contaminated food
- Needles
- Sexual contact

### Use PPE:
- Gloves
- Goggles or sunglasses
- Masks
- Gowns

> [!warning] Always look before searching a person or area to avoid contamination

## Exposure to Blood or Bodily Fluids

### If exposed:
1. **Turn over patient care** to another EMS provider
2. **Clean affected area** with warm water and soap
3. **Rinse eyes with water** for 20 minutes if exposed
4. **Activate the department's infection control plan**
5. **Seek immediate medical follow-up**

### Document:
- Time
- Date
- Location
- Circumstances
- Copies of related reports

## Injury Prevention

- **Must be part of your daily routine**
- **Stay physically fit**
- **Be able to drive aggressively** when necessary, but always safely

## Surviving Violence

> [!warning] Law enforcement is a high-risk profession

- **Always stay aware**
- **Be alert to hazards**
- **Watch people's hands, not their faces**
  - Hands can kill. Faces cannot.

## Support for Mental Wellness

Many departments provide:
- Chaplains
- Trained peer-support officers
- Support staff
- Access to doctors/mental health professionals

## Stress Exposure in Law Enforcement

### Officers are regularly exposed to:
- Dangerous situations
- Overwhelming sights, sounds, and smells
- Critically ill/injured individuals
- Dead or dying people, including infants
- Highly emotional or angry individuals

### Non-Work Stress Factors:
- Financial struggles
- Relationship conflict
- Work-life balance
- Physical health issues
- Spiritual challenges

## Cumulative Stress

**Cumulative Stress** is the build-up of stress over time.

### Signs of Stress:
- Irritability
- Loss of appetite
- Sleep disruption
- Indecisiveness
- Social isolation
- Physical aches/pains

## Stress Management Strategies

- Regular physical exercise
- Adequate rest and recovery
- Time off for self-care and hobbies
- Peer support or counseling
- Healthy diet and hydration

## Dealing with Death & Dying

- **You may have to notify families**
- **Everyone's response to grief is different**

### Stages of Grief:
1. Denial
2. Anger/Hostility
3. Bargaining
4. Depression
5. Acceptance

## Line of Duty Death (LODD)

- **On average, 140 police officers die in the line of duty each year**
- **Vehicle crashes are the leading cause**
- **You can do everything right and still not make it home**

### Immediate Actions After Officer Death
- **The "zero hour" begins immediately**
- **Be thorough and careful**
- **Manage the scene appropriately**
- **Ensure nothing is overlooked**

## Warning Signs of Serious Stress Response

- Chest pain
- Shortness of breath
- Severe pain
- Visual disturbances

# CPR & Emergency Response

## Core Principles of CPR

> [!quote] "Any CPR is better than no CPR."

- **CPR = Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation**
- **CPR is unlikely to hurt someone**
- **Survival drops 10% for every minute CPR is not performed**
- **AEDs can be used by anyone**
- **CPR and AED are safe for use on pregnant women**

> [!warning] Good Samaritan laws protect civilians, not police — officers have a duty to act and perform properly

> [!important] Practice CPR frequently

## Heart Attack vs. Cardiac Arrest

| Heart Attack | Cardiac Arrest |
|--------------|----------------|
| Blood flow cut off to part of the heart | Heart quivers, fails to pump blood |
| Often caused by blood clot | Requires CPR and AED to survive |
| May be awake and breathing | Person is unconscious, not breathing |

## CPR Process (Adult – Basic Steps)

1. **Secure the scene**
2. **Check for responsiveness** (tap, shout, sternum rub)
3. **Shout for help**
4. **Call 911**
5. **Ask for AED** from bystanders
6. **Check for breathing** (observe for 5–10 seconds)
7. **Lay flat**
8. **Remove bulky clothing** over chest area
9. **Start CPR**: 30 chest compressions → 2 breaths

> [!warning] Gasping is not breathing

## Chest Compressions

- **Hands-only CPR is acceptable** if untrained
- **Most important part of CPR**

### Technique:
- **Depth**: At least 2 inches
- **Rate**: 100–120 bpm
- **Let chest fully recoil**
- **Do not interrupt** for more than 10 seconds

## Airway & Rescue Breaths

### Open the airway:
- Hand on forehead
- Hand on chin
- Tilt and lift (smelling position)

### Face Shield or Pocket Mask:
- Can be mouth-to-mouth or mouth-to-nose
- Face shields = single use
- Pocket masks = reusable
- Give 2 breaths
- Watch for chest rise to confirm effectiveness

## AED Use

**Use the AED immediately upon arrival**, even in the middle of CPR:

1. **Turn AED on**
2. **Place pads**
   - Avoid pacemakers, chemo ports, or medicine pouches
   - Place pads on bare skin
3. **Attach leads**
4. **Follow AED prompts**
5. **If advised, deliver shock**
6. **Immediately resume CPR**

> [!note] No AED difference for pregnant patients

## CPR Depth & Technique by Age Group

| Group | Compression Depth | Ratio (C:C) | Hand Placement |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Adult** | 2 inches | 30:2 | Palms (stacked) |
| **Child** | 2 inches | 30:2 | One or both palms depending on size |
| **Infant** | 1.5 inches | 30:2 | 2 fingers or thumbs/hands encircling chest |

## Opioid Overdose Cases

- **OD can lead to cardiac arrest**
- **Use Narcan (Naloxone)** if available

## Choking – Adults

**Usually caused by food blockage**

### If mild obstruction (can cough, speak):
- Encourage them to cough it out

### If severe obstruction:
1. Ask if they're choking
2. Ask to help
3. **Perform abdominal thrusts**:
   - Fist just above naval
   - Grab fist with other hand
   - Thrust inward and upward

> [!warning] If pregnant or obese, move hands to chest/diaphragm area

**If they become unresponsive, begin CPR**

## Choking – Children

1. **Secure the scene**
2. **Observe the situation**
3. **Follow same procedure as adults**

## Choking – Infants

1. **Support head and jaw**
2. **Place face-down on forearm**
3. **Deliver 5 back slaps** between shoulder blades
4. **Turn infant over**
5. **Deliver 5 chest thrusts** with 2 fingers
6. **Repeat until the infant cries or coughs**

**If unresponsive, begin CPR**
