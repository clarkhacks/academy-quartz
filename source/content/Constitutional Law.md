# Constitutional Law

## Standards of Evidence

Understanding the levels of proof required in different legal contexts:

### Ascending Order of Evidence:

1. **Hunch** – No legal value; just a feeling
2. **Reasonably Indicative** – Slight indication
3. **Reasonable Suspicion** – Can justify a stop or brief detention
4. **Probable Cause** – Needed for arrest or search
5. **Preponderance of Evidence** – More likely than not (used in civil cases)
6. **Clear and Convincing Evidence** – Highly probable
7. **Beyond a Reasonable Doubt** – Required for criminal conviction
8. **Absolute Certainty** – Not a legal standard; theoretical

> [!important] Key Point
> Facts are the only valid basis for a legal decision or police action. A finding of guilty or not guilty is determined by whether the available facts equate to proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

## Legal Thresholds for Action

| Legal Level | Trigger | Police Authority |
|-------------|---------|------------------|
| **Mere Hunch** | Intuition only | Voluntary contact |
| **Reasonable Suspicion** | Specific, articulable facts | Investigative detention (Terry Stop) |
| **Probable Cause** | Facts suggest crime likely occurred | Arrest |
| **Beyond a Reasonable Doubt** | Highest standard of proof | Conviction |

### Flow of Contact to Arrest:
1. **Suspect Detained** on Reasonable Suspicion
2. **Investigation** gathers additional evidence
3. **If Probable Cause is established** → Arrest occurs
4. **Further legal proceedings** may result in conviction

## Criminal vs. Civil Law

| Feature | Criminal Law | Civil Law |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| **Parties Involved** | State vs. Person | Person vs. Person (Tort) |
| **Burden of Proof** | Beyond a Reasonable Doubt | Preponderance of Evidence (51%) |
| **Penalties** | Fines, Prison, Death | Typically monetary only ($) |
| **Legal Focus** | Crime | Tort (civil wrong) |

## The Constitution

**The Constitution is the primary legal document in the U.S.**

It:
- Created the federal government
- Defines basic citizen rights
- Replaces the monarch as the source of legal authority
- Applies to everyone, including government officials

> [!important] Police officers have a duty to protect the rights outlined in the Constitution.

## Structure of the Constitution

- **The Constitution (1789)** – Framework of government
- **The Bill of Rights (1791)** – First 10 Amendments
- **Additional Amendments** – Subsequent changes to the Constitution
- **Substantive Changes** – Revisions that affect the meaning or scope of rights

## The Bill of Rights

**Designed to protect citizens from government overreach**

Defines the basic rights guaranteed to all U.S. citizens

### Key Amendments for Peace Officers:
- **1st Amendment** – Freedom of speech, religion, assembly, press
- **4th Amendment** – Protection against unreasonable searches and seizures
- **5th Amendment** – Protection against self-incrimination and double jeopardy
- **6th Amendment** – Right to a fair and speedy trial

## 14th Amendment

**Ensures states cannot override federally protected rights**

A state may not pass laws that infringe upon federal constitutional rights

## Branches of Government and Role of Police Officers

### Three Branches of Government:

1. **Legislative Branch** – Produces laws
2. **Executive Branch** – Enforces laws
   > [!note] Police Officers fall under this branch – "The Action Branch"
3. **Judicial Branch** – Interprets and decides the laws

> [!important] Officers do not interpret laws — they identify violators and refer cases to the judicial system.

## Court Structure – Missouri vs. Federal

### Missouri Court Structure:
- **Circuit Courts**
  - Associate Circuit Judges
  - "Specialty Courts": Veterans, Traffic, Divorce, Disabled
- **Missouri Court of Appeals**
- **Missouri Supreme Court**

Cases may go to the U.S. Supreme Court if involving federal issues.

### U.S. Federal Court Structure:
- **U.S. District Courts**
  - Includes Magistrate Judges
  - First level of trial (testimony & evidence)
- **U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals**
  - Reviews procedure only – no new evidence
- **U.S. Supreme Court**

> [!note] Appellate courts may remand a case to Circuit Court for retrial.

## Key Legal Concepts for Officers

- **Recording in Public**: May only restrict recording if it interferes with police duties
- **Exclusionary Rule**: Illegally obtained evidence is inadmissible in court
- **Due Process**: Rights without a remedy or enforcement have no value
- **Custody Standard**: If a reasonable person would not feel free to leave, the subject is in custody
  - Example: Restricting movement = custody

## From Apprehension to Trial

### Flow of the Justice Process:
1. **Apprehension** → Detention
2. **Investigation** builds Probable Cause
3. **Arrest** made if PC is established
4. **Warrant Application** Procedure
5. **Pre-Trial Hearings**
6. **Discovery Phase**
7. **The Trial**

### Booking Process:
- Administrative step (not constitutionally required)
- Used for record-keeping, not legal necessity

## State-Specific Procedures – Missouri

- **Missouri 24-Hour Rule**: If a warrantless arrest occurs, a warrant application must be filed within 24 hours
- **Released Pending Application for Warrant (RPAW)**: A subject may be released temporarily while waiting for a formal warrant

## Role of the Prosecutor

### 4 Options a Prosecutor Has After Review:
1. **Issue Charges**
2. **Refuse Charges**
3. **Take Under Advisement**
4. **Request Further Investigation** (or Request Additional Evidence)

## Mob Justice vs. Legal Process

- **Mob Justice** is driven by emotion, not law
- **A mob has no duty** to protect constitutional rights
- **If an officer behaves like a mob**: That is worse, because officers are sworn to uphold the law, not violate it

---

# Exclusionary Rule & Evidence

## Exclusionary Rule

**If evidence is collected illegally, it is inadmissible in court**

This rule is grounded in the principle of "Right and Remedy"

### Fruit of the Poisonous Tree Doctrine
Extends the exclusionary rule to evidence discovered as a result of excluded evidence

### Intended Effects of the Exclusionary Rule:
- Punish officers who ignore constitutional rights
- Encourage greater respect for law enforcement practices

> [!warning] Controversy: Some guilty individuals may go free because of improper evidence collection

## Exceptions to the Exclusionary Rule

### 1. Patane Exception
**Physical evidence voluntarily submitted without full Miranda warning is admissible**

Example: Miranda read halfway, suspect interrupts and says, "I KNOW MY RIGHTS," then voluntarily discloses information (e.g., "There's a gun in my house").

### 2. Impeachment
**Uncoerced but inadmissible confessions/admissions may be used to challenge the credibility of the defendant's testimony.**

### 3. Good Faith Exception (U.S. v. Leon)
**Evidence found under a defective warrant is admissible if:**
- The officer reasonably relied on the warrant
- Error was made by a judge, dispatcher, or clerk

### 4. Independent Source
**Admits evidence that was obtained independently of the illegal conduct**, even if a related action was improper.

### 5. Inevitable Discovery
**If it can be proven that the evidence would have been discovered anyway, it is admissible**

Can involve police or civilians discovering it by legal means

### 6. Attenuation Doctrine
**If enough time or events separate the unlawful action from the discovery of evidence, exclusion may not apply**

Example: Officer unlawfully stops someone, but then finds a valid, unrelated warrant.

## Entrapment

**Entrapment occurs when the suspect is convinced to commit a crime they would not have otherwise committed.**

- Must prove a culpable mental state to hold someone liable
- Simply providing the opportunity (e.g., bait cars) is not entrapment
- Do not compel or convince a suspect to commit a crime

## Duty to Preserve Evidence

**Officers must preserve evidence that may be favorable to the suspect**

## Voluntariness of Confessions

### To be admissible, a confession must be:

**a. Voluntary**
- Given freely by the suspect

**b. Involuntary Factors (coercion):**
- Threats
- Continuous interrogation
- Deprivation of food or sleep
- General coercion

> [!warning] If a confession is coerced, it is not voluntary and is inadmissible

## Miranda v. Arizona

**Miranda rights ensure that suspects are aware of their constitutional rights**

- Applies to testimonial evidence

### Miranda is Required When:
**Custody + Interrogation** are both present

### Cautions on Giving Miranda:
Giving Miranda too early may:
- Deter a suspect from making a statement
- Imply an arrest occurred when it may not have

## Who Must Read Miranda?

### Required:
- Police officers
- Police agents

### Not Required:
- Undercover officers
- Private citizens
- Security guards

# Legal Process & Court Procedures

## 4 Actions a Prosecutor May Take After an Arrest Warrant Application

1. **Issue an Information** → Accepted for warrant by judge
2. **Refuse to Information** → Case is too weak, has issues, or cannot be sold to a judge
3. **Take Under Advisement** → Needs more support/information (informally) — often reviewed within 30 days
4. **Send to Grand Jury** → Allows the grand jury to decide if there is sufficient probable cause

## Grand Jury Process

- A grand jury consists of **9–12 people** selected from the same pool as trial (petit) jurors
- Can issue a **True Bill of Indictment**

## Charging Documents Defined

- **Information** → A charging document written by the prosecutor that states facts = probable cause and the specific charge(s)
- **Arrest Warrant** → A court order issued by a judge directing law enforcement to bring a named person to court to face charges
- **Indictment** → A formal charge issued by a grand jury, written by the prosecutor

## 4 Possible Pleas to a Charge

1. **Guilty**
2. **Not Guilty**
3. **Not Guilty by Reason of Mental Defect or Mental Illness** (Insanity)
4. **Alford Plea** (No Contest)

## Issuance of Charging Documents

### 3 Steps to Formal Charging:
1. **Initial Judicial Notice of Charging**
2. **Arraignment**
3. **Completion of Both Steps**

> [!important] A suspect is formally charged when all 3 steps are completed

## Discovery Process

> [!warning] Law enforcement work is most scrutinized during discovery.

### 3 Key Steps in Discovery:

1. **Motion to Discover (Defense)**
   - Learn what evidence the prosecution has
2. **Motion to Suppress (Defense)**
   - Request that certain evidence be excluded
3. **Suppression Hearing**
   - Both parties present arguments
   - Judge rules on each item's admissibility

## Plea Bargains

**Defendant agrees to plead guilty to a lesser charge or reduced sentence**

Helps move cases efficiently while still placing a record on the defendant

## The 4 Players of a Trial

| Role | Duties |
|------|--------|
| **Prosecuting Attorney** | Fight for the state, prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt |
| **Defense Attorney** | Fight for the defense, create reasonable doubt, block inadmissible evidence |
| **Judge** | Rule on motions, determine sentencing, maintain order |
| **Jury** | Decide facts, assess credibility, determine guilt or innocence |

### Police Officer's Role in Trial
- **As Investigator** → Member of the prosecution team
- **As Witness** → Provide an unbiased report of the facts

## Evidence Basics

- **Evidence** → Any testimony or item entered into court to prove an issue or support an action
- **Chain of Custody** → Tracks who had the evidence and when, from seizure to courtroom, to prove authenticity
- **Best Evidence Rule** → The original document is considered best because it's least likely to have undetectable alterations

# Search Warrants & Fourth Amendment

## Search Warrants

### Definition
**A search warrant is:**
An order in writing to a law enforcement officer commanding them to search a particular place and bring specific property, if found, to the judge.

### Benefits of Search Warrants
- Makes the search more reasonable and difficult to challenge in court
- Even if it's a legal search, if possible a search warrant can be a great tool

### Search Warrant Affidavit Requirements
Must be:
- **Written**
- **Time/date of making application**
- **IDs items being searched for and seized** in sufficient detail
- **The probable cause had**
- **And the facts**

> [!warning] If info is stale (typically older than 24 hours) judges are more reluctant to sign a warrant

### "Reasonable Time" Definition
- Time it takes to locate item in search warrant
- Time it takes to thoroughly search where that item could be
- Together those are reasonable time

### Missouri Search Warrant Rules
- **Missouri search warrants are in effect for 10 days max**
- **If you leave the search warrant area** a new warrant must be issued (unless leaving for an emergency)
- **Always leave someone on scene**

> [!tip] Search Warrant Strategy
> Don't get a search warrant for "just the gun" - get one for the ammo, the ammo boxes, the case it was sold in, the receipt, the papers it came with, materials to reload ammunition, etc. Everything related to it. This gives you more area to look, more items to be discovered, and a better chance at finding items you didn't think were relevant, or even items related to a different crime.

### Important Limitations
- **A warrant for premises doesn't automatically justify search of the person** on that premises (unless named persons)
- **If the majority of business is legitimate** such as patrons at a bar, leave the patrons alone
- **Officers must have reason to believe** that all individuals at the location are involved

## Four Steps to Gain Entry

1. **Knock loudly enough** to be heard throughout the entire premises
2. **Announce authority** - "This is a (department) police officer"
3. **Announce purpose** by stating you have a search warrant
4. **Demand entry**

### No-Knock Warrants Allowed When:
- Officer believes there would be **danger** to them/other persons if they knocked
- If knocking will create a **hostage situation**
- If knocking will result in **destruction of the evidence**
- If knocking would be **futile**

## Four Responses to Knocking

### 1. Admittance
- Begin the search at once
- Don't argue, you have "command to search"
- One officer should explain the warrant

### 2. Refusal
- Make immediate forced entry
- Entry is legal
- Must only be a reasonable amount of force to enter

### 3. Silence
- Wait 15-20 seconds
- If not easily disposed of, wait
- If reasonable disposed of, enter with force promptly

### 4. Ambiguous Response
- Handle based on circumstances

> [!important] Reasonable force here is only what is minimally required. The entry being done improperly could trigger the exclusionary rule.

## Post-Search Procedures

### What Happens When Occupied?

| Situation | Warrant Copy | Items Seized | Secure Premises |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Unoccupied** | Leave warrant copy in conspicuous area | Leave copy with warrant | Secure it |
| **Occupied** | Give copy of warrant | Give receipt of items | They can do it |
| **Occupant Arrested** | Put it away in structure or bring to booking for inventory | Put in structure with warrant copy or bring to booking for inventory | Secure it |

### Final Requirements
- **Return the original search warrant** to the prosecutor within 2 days of execution
- **Media invites** to the execution of a search warrant are not allowed unless necessary

## Abandoned Property

### Definition
**The property must be abandoned:**
- Voluntarily relinquished interest in it and therefore has "no expectation of privacy"
- They must have no expectation of returning to it

### How to Determine Abandonment:
- Left unattended or unclaimed for a long period of time
- Conduct of suspect + manner of disposal
- How long was it unattended?
- Condition of it?
- Flight from the scene?
- Denial of ownership?

> [!note] Missouri Supreme Court ruled that a vehicle is abandoned in a case of pursuit where vehicle is left at scene, motor running, doors open.

**Abandoned property is not covered under the 4th amendment.** Once abandonment is established, no further justification of search is necessary.

## Privacy Expectations & Property Types

### Definitions by Privacy Level:

- **Open Field**: Any area of public/private property which the owner has no reasonable expectation of privacy
- **Curtilage**: The area immediately around a dwelling used for family/intimate life activities
- **Quasi-Public Area**: Walkway from street → front door. Front porches, a walkway with no reasonable attempt to restrict access
- **Public Area**: The public has unrestricted access

### 4 Factors of Curtilage:
1. **Proximity to the home**
2. **Is it included in a structure/enclosure** surrounding the home?
3. **Nature of the use of area**
4. **Essential** - the steps taken by home owner or resident to exclude others from the area

## Justification for Searching Private Property

1. **Officers may treat it as open field** if legitimate investigative purpose exists
2. **Legitimate investigative purpose** is an articulable reason to suspect that particular evidence of a particular crime is currently to be found at this particular location
3. **Although not legally defined as such**, it can be looked at as reasonable suspicion for a search

### Additional Privacy Considerations:
- **You must ask to search** belongings of a bus
- **If the owner has taken steps to create privacy** - it's important to consider
- **Individuals may lose expectation of privacy** in public place if not used for its intended purpose (Ex: Sex in a restroom)
- **Surveillance is admissible** if it can be seen from somewhere you are legally allowed to be, even if using binoculars

## Plain View Doctrine

### 3 Elements Required for Seizure Under Plain View:
1. **You see it from a location** you have a right to be
2. **You immediately "at first sight"** have probable cause the items are evidence of a particular crime
3. **You have legal access** to the area where the item currently is in order to seize it

**Plain view is "no search"** - you seize the item and do no further investigation

### If You See Evidence Where You Do Not Have a Right to Be:
- **Impound the house** by staging officers to prevent destruction
- **Get a search warrant**
- **If an attempt is made to move evidence** you may seize it
- **If attempt to destroy is made** you may make a warrantless entry to prevent destruction

## Private Citizens & Fourth Amendment

- **Private citizens are not bound by the 4th amendment** - they are not the government (civil cases could be used though)
- **Exception**: If private citizen is an agent of the police

### Rules for Private Citizen Searches:
- **Info provided by private citizens** can be followed up on but not more intrusively
- **Officer can REPEAT search** made by private citizen
- **Search cannot go further** though
- **If LEO directs, encourages, or participates** in a private search it is no longer a private search

## Drug Dogs

**Drug dogs sniffing are not "searches"** as long as there is no intrusion to protected area. Use must be justified as well.

## Fourth Amendment Summary

- **No unreasonable search and seizures**
- **No issuance of warrant without probable cause**

# Contact, Detention, and Arrest

## Three Levels of Police Contact

| Level | Freedom | Justification Required |
|-------|---------|----------------------|
| **Contact** | Voluntary, free to go whenever | General suspicion/a hunch |
| **Detention** | Reasonable suspicion, not free to go only for as long as reasonable to investigate | Reasonable suspicion |
| **Arrest** | Not free to go | Probable cause |

## Voluntary Contact

### Characteristics:
- **NOT a seizure**
- **Justify contact** by general suspicion/a hunch
- **No force can be used**
- **No searches, no frisks**
- **No Miranda**, even with guilt-seeking questions

## Investigative Detention

### Definition:
**A limited seizure of a person on reasonable suspicion**

### Requirements:
- **Reasonable suspicion**
- **Facts to equal reasonable suspicion:**
  - First-hand knowledge
  - Time of day
  - Reputation of the area
  - Suspicious statements or conduct
  - Person's demeanor

### Avoiding Unauthorized Arrest During Detention:
Consider:
- **Duration of stop** (20-30 minutes)
- **Movement limitation** of subject
- **Degree of force used**

> [!tip] Even if using cuffs during detention, explain they are not under arrest. Must articulate why cuffs are being used. Don't just say "for my safety" - explain it to them.

### Detention Rules:
- **Frisking is authorized** for detention (must have reasonable suspicion though)
- **Miranda is not needed** during detention even if asking guilt-seeking questions
- **An officer cannot force answers** to questions and may only detain them for duration of the investigation during detention

## Arrest

### Characteristics:
- **Arrest is a seizure**
- **If controlling them by force** it's arrest
- **Minimum justification**: Probable cause

### Facts for Probable Cause:
- Personal knowledge
- Senses
- Admission of criminal acts
- Personal experience

### Arrest Authority:
- **You may keep an arrestee** under close/constant surveillance until transported to police station
- **You may use necessary non-lethal force** to maintain custody
- **US Supreme Court says** use of deadly force must be considered on a case-by-case basis
- **Full search + "leaping range"** authorized
- **Miranda not required** unless asking guilt-seeking questions

## Reasonable Suspicion vs. Probable Cause

### For Detention (Reasonable Suspicion):
Must be reasonably suspected that:
- **Crime was/is/is about to be committed**
- **Suspect is involved**

### For Arrest (Probable Cause):
You need **facts and circumstances** that lead to probable cause

## Reliable Information Factors

### For Criminal Information:
- **Previously reliable**
- **Statement against own interests**
- **Highly likely is first-hand info**
- **Corroborated by police**

---

# Stop & Frisk Procedures

## Stop & Frisk – Persons

  - Attempt to hide something?
  - Hands repeatedly move to pockets?

### 2. Legal Scope of Frisk

- Limited to **outer clothing**
- **Plain Feel Doctrine**: may remove item if it's clearly contraband within time needed to determine it's not a weapon
- Limited search of **containers/bags** if weapon-like object seen or felt
- If concern but cannot open reasonably → **isolate** it

## Stop & Frisk – Vehicle

- Must be a lawful stop
- **Reasonable suspicion required to stop a vehicle**

---

  - Reason to believe person is inside
  - Arrest warrant OR exigent circumstances

#### At 3rd-party residence:
- No consent or emergency = prohibited
- Felony arrest warrant only
- SW for suspect required

### 2. Additional Officer Actions:
- Ask for license/registration/insurance
- Ask for consent to search
- Control occupants
- Drug dog sniff from outside
- Plain view evidence = probable cause
- Portable containers may be searched if PC exists
- Search ends when evidence no longer present

### Probable Cause in Vehicle = Full Search
- May search **any part** of the vehicle that could contain the item
- **If PC is container-specific** and not found there → container search ends

## Special Cases

### Mobile Homes
- If detached and affixed to ground = **not mobile**, needs warrant
- If mobile = treat like a vehicle

---

# Emergency and Consent Searches

## Emergency Search
- Must reasonably believe emergency exists
- Limited to scope of emergency

---

# Physical Evidence Collection

## No Warrant or Consent Needed IF:
- Collecting physical evidence from a person
- e.g., stomach pumping, holding down for blood draw
- **"Shocking to conscience"** → Suppressed

### Other ways to get physical evidence:
- Consent
- Court order
- **Grand Jury Subpoena**
