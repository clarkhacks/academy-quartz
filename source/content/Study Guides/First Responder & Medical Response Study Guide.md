# First Responder & Medical Response Study Guide

*Study guide for [[First Responder & Medical Response]]*

## Combat Gauze Application (5 Steps)
1. **Identify major bleeding site**
2. **Apply hemostatic agent** (Combat gauze)
3. **Pack to the bone** - fill entire wound cavity
4. **Apply direct pressure** for 3+ minutes
5. **Apply over-bandage** to secure

## Chest Injuries
- **Pneumothorax** - Air between lungs and chest wall
- **Hemothorax** - Blood between lungs and chest wall
- **Tension pneumothorax** - Heart/trachea displaced

**Major sign:** Shortness of breath

## Shock Indicators
- Altered mental state
- Body temperature change
- **Capillary refill >3 seconds**
- Pale, moist skin
- Fast breathing
- **Radial pulse present = ~80 mmHg systolic BP**

## Hypothermia Prevention
- Minimize exposure
- Replace wet clothes
- Cover to retain heat
- Reapply body armor for warmth

> **Why it matters:** Small temp drop interferes with clotting

## Recovery Position
- **Left side down**
- Right arm under chin, over left arm
- Left arm bent under head
- Right knee bent

## ABC Priority
**A**irway → **B**reathing → **C**irculation

## Airway Management
- **Head/chin tilt** ("smelling position")
- **If talking, no NPA needed**
- Have patient maintain own airway if possible

## EMS Professional Levels
- **EMR** - Basic skills, keep alive
- **EMT** - Basic Life Support
- **Paramedic** - Advanced care (EKG, IVs, meds)

## Consent Types
- **Expressed** - Patient asks for help
- **Informed** - Patient understands risks (18+)
- **Implied** - Unconscious/unable to consent

## Officer Wellness - 5 Components
1. Spiritual
2. Occupational
3. Physical
4. Personal & Emotional
5. Family & Social

**Key Stats:**
- Police suicide rate: 2x general public
- LEO divorce rate: 60-75%

## CPR Basics
- **"Any CPR is better than no CPR"**
- Survival drops 10% per minute without CPR
- **30 compressions : 2 breaths**
- **Depth:** 2 inches (adult), 1.5 inches (infant)
- **Rate:** 100-120 BPM

## AED Use
1. Turn on
2. Place pads on bare skin
3. Attach leads
4. Follow prompts
5. Deliver shock if advised
6. Resume CPR immediately

## Choking Response
**Adults/Children:**
- Mild obstruction: Encourage coughing
- Severe: Abdominal thrusts above navel

**Infants:**
- 5 back slaps between shoulder blades
- 5 chest thrusts with 2 fingers
- Repeat until crying/coughing

## Stress Management
**Signs of stress:** Irritability, appetite loss, sleep disruption, indecisiveness, isolation

**Management:** Exercise, rest, time off, peer support, healthy diet

## Fire Safety

### 3 Components of Fire
1. **Fuel** - Solid, liquid, gas (anything that can burn)
2. **Oxygen** - Usually present in adequate air
3. **Heat** - Must reach combustion temperature

> **To extinguish fire, must remove one of the three components**

### Smoke Inhalation
- **Severe injury or death**
- **Full of toxic gases**
- **Use caution to avoid it**

### Fire Classes & Extinguishing Methods
- **Class A** (Wood, paper, textiles) → Water
- **Class B** (Gasoline, oils) → Dry foam, CO₂
- **Class C** (Electrical hazards) → CO₂
- **Class D** (Burning metals) → Salt-based (NO WATER)
- **Class K** (Kitchen grease) → Oxygen-suppressing agent

### 3 Common Types of Extinguishers
- Air pressurized water
- CO₂
- Dry Chemical

### Fire Extinguisher Inspection
**Check:** Gauge, inspection tag, pin & handle, hose
**Inspect can for:** Rust, dents

### PASS Method for Fire Extinguishers
1. **Pull** pin
2. **Aim** nozzle at base of fire
3. **Squeeze** lever to discharge
4. **Sweep** nozzle side to side

## Hazmat Response
**Important: ID the substance involved**
**Position:** Uphill, upwind
**Look for:** Placards, labels, containers, tank shapes/sizes

## Vehicle Safety
**Disconnect the Battery** - Some are in trunk or under seats

## Vital Signs & Assessment

### Adult Respiratory Rate
**12–20 BPM** (Breaths per minute)

### Blood Glucose Average
**70–100 mg/dL**

### Pulse Oximetry Normal
**95–100%**

### Reassessment Intervals
- **Every 5 min for unstable patients**
- **Every 15 min for stable patients**

## Airway & Breathing Details
- **4–6 minutes = Irreversible damage without O₂**
- **Tongue = most common obstruction**
- **Inspiration:** Breathing in
- **Expiration:** Breathing out
- **Ventilation:** Both

## Splinting
**Check PMS:** Pulse, Motor, Sensitivity at injury site
**Do PMS first + last, before & after splinting**

## Amputations
**Try to bring it with the patient**

## Burns

### Burn Depths
- **Superficial Burn** = Surface (1st degree)
- **Partial Thickness** = Outer + Middle layers (2nd degree)
- **Full Thickness** = All 3 layers; nerve damage likely (3rd degree)

### Severe Burns
- **20% = Children**
- **25% = Adults**
- **Hands, feet, face, genitals** = automatically severe

### Managing Burns
1. **STOP the burn first**
2. Remove patient from source
3. Remove clothing if possible
4. Remove chemicals
5. Monitor ABCs
6. Keep warm/calm
7. **Smoke inhalation:** look around eyes, nose, mouth

## Shock (Expanded)

### Shock Types + Causes
- **Cardiogenic:** Heart failure
- **Spinal:** Brain can't message to shrink blood vessels
- **Septic:** Toxins from infection open vessels

### 3 Categories of Shock
1. **Compensated:** Early, body can keep up
2. **Decompensated:** Late, body can't keep up
3. **Irreversible:** Leads to death, last stage

## Pharmacology

### Drug Administration Routes
**Standard Routes:** Inhalation, IV, IM (Intramuscular), Oral, Sublingual
**Emergency Routes:** Intraosseous injection, Rectal, Subcutaneous injection, Transcutaneous (through skin)

### 5 Rights of Medication
1. Right patient
2. Right medication
3. Right dose
4. Right route
5. Right time

### Drug Schedules
- **Schedule 1** → No medical use, high abuse potential
- **Schedule 2** → HIGH dependency, accepted medical use
