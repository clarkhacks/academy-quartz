*Study guide for [[Constitutional Law]]*

## Standards of Evidence (Ascending Order)
1. **Hunch** - No legal value
2. **Reasonably Indicative** - Slight indication
3. **Reasonable Suspicion** - Can justify stop/detention
4. **Probable Cause** - Needed for arrest/search
5. **Preponderance of Evidence** - More likely than not (civil)
6. **Clear and Convincing Evidence** - Highly probable
7. **Beyond a Reasonable Doubt** - Criminal conviction
8. **Absolute Certainty** - Not a legal standard

## Key Legal Thresholds
- **Mere Hunch** → Voluntary contact only
- **Reasonable Suspicion** → Terry Stop (investigative detention)
- **Probable Cause** → Arrest authority
- **Beyond Reasonable Doubt** → Conviction

## Criminal vs Civil Law
| Criminal | Civil |
|----------|-------|
| State vs Person | Person vs Person |
| Beyond Reasonable Doubt | Preponderance (51%) |
| Fines/Prison/Death | Monetary damages |

## Key Constitutional Amendments
- **1st** - Speech, religion, assembly, press
- **4th** - Protection from unreasonable search/seizure
- **5th** - Self-incrimination, double jeopardy
- **6th** - Fair and speedy trial
- **14th** - States cannot override federal rights

## Three Branches of Government
1. **Legislative** - Makes laws
2. **Executive** - Enforces laws (Police are here)
3. **Judicial** - Interprets laws

> **Remember:** Officers identify violators, don't interpret laws

## Exclusionary Rule

- **Exceptions:** Patane, Impeachment, Good Faith, Independent Source, Inevitable Discovery, Attenuation

## Miranda Requirements
- **Custody + Interrogation** = Miranda required
- Only applies to testimonial evidence
- Not required for undercover officers or private citizens

## Search Warrants
- **Missouri warrants valid for 10 days**
- Must knock, announce authority, announce purpose, demand entry
- **No-knock allowed:** Danger, hostage situation, evidence destruction, futility

## Contact Levels
1. **Contact** - Voluntary, general suspicion
2. **Detention** - Reasonable suspicion, not free to go
3. **Arrest** - Probable cause, full custody

## Stop & Frisk Procedures

### Legal Justification of Frisk
- Must be a **lawful stop**
- Must have **reasonable suspicion** of dangerous weapons on person
- Consider: weapon-related crime, criminal record, behavior, bulges, hiding attempts

### Legal Scope of Frisk
- Limited to **outer clothing**
- **Plain Feel Doctrine**: may remove clearly contraband items
- Limited search of containers if weapon-like object detected

### Vehicle Stop & Frisk

## Arrest Procedures

### Arrest at Residence
- For forcible entry: need reason to believe person inside + arrest warrant OR exigent circumstances
- **Cannot arrest for minor crime in private place** (must be felony)
- **DWI = minor crime** per court ruling
- **"Hot pursuit" may allow entry without warrant**

### Arrest Authority
- Officer may arrest for any offense (including traffic/ordinance violations)
- Even infractions with only fine penalty

## Vehicle Searches Without Warrant

### Motor Vehicle Stops
- Need **reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct** OR **PC of traffic violation**
- **PC in vehicle = full search** of any part that could contain the item
- **If PC is container-specific** and not found → container search ends

### Officer Actions During Stop
- Ask for license/registration/insurance
- Ask for consent to search
- Control occupants
- Drug dog sniff from outside
- Plain view evidence = probable cause

## Physical Evidence Collection

### No Warrant/Consent Needed IF:
- Collecting physical evidence from person
- **"Shocking to conscience"** → Suppressed
