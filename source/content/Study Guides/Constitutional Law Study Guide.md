## Standards of Evidence (Ascending Order)
1. **Hunch** - No legal value
2. **Reasonably Indicative** - Slight indication
3. **Reasonable Suspicion** - Can justify stop/detention
4. **Probable Cause** - Needed for arrest/search
5. **Preponderance of Evidence** - More likely than not (civil)
6. **Clear and Convincing Evidence** - Highly probable
7. **Beyond a Reasonable Doubt** - Criminal conviction
8. **Absolute Certainty** - Not a legal standard

## Key Legal Thresholds
- **Mere Hunch** → Voluntary contact only
- **Reasonable Suspicion** → Terry Stop (investigative detention)
- **Probable Cause** → Arrest authority
- **Beyond Reasonable Doubt** → Conviction

## Criminal vs Civil Law
| Criminal | Civil |
|----------|-------|
| State vs Person | Person vs Person |
| Beyond Reasonable Doubt | Preponderance (51%) |
| Fines/Prison/Death | Monetary damages |

## Three Branches of Government
1. **Legislative** - Makes laws
2. **Executive** - Enforces laws (Police are here)
3. **Judicial** - Interprets laws

> **Remember:** Officers identify violators, don't interpret laws
